# Distributables

Compiled files and miscellaneous assets intended to be used be used by end
users go here.  The files here should be generated from files in other
directories.  The build process should place its outputted files in this
directory.

It is not wise to edit the files in this directory manually, as they will be
overwritten by the build process.
